pdfrw is a basic PDF file manipulation library.  Developed and tested on Python 2.5-2.7.

pdfrw can read and write PDF files, and can also be used to read in PDFs which can then be used inside [reportlab](http://www.reportlab.org/).

For more information:

  * The ExampleTools show how to use pdfrw both with and without [reportlab](http://www.reportlab.org/).
  * Browse the library SourceFiles.
  * Read about the internal ObjectModel.
  * The SupportedFeatures page describes pdfrw capabilities.
  * Look at OtherLibraries and tools for PDFs.
